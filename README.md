Key problems that may occur
- sharing a listing
-- thjs required a websiye link, im not too well with responsivness when it comes to mobile - web as yet however this project should enhance that aspect
- Filtering may become a slight problem but nothing i cant research and hajdle
- Id like to add a recommendeds listing, recommendeds would take from clicks in a certain category or item, items purchased etc.
